# Nary Programming Language

> **Power in Simplicity.**

---

## Overview

Nary is a systems programming language built for simplicity, clarity, safety, and speed. It combines the simplicity of C, readability of Python, safety of Rust, and speed of C++.

Nary aims to remove hidden behavior from programming. No garbage collector, no borrow checker, no surprises. It only abstracts what's already intuitive.

## Philosophy

- Follows RAII Principals
- Destructors Make Cleanup Obvious
- No Hidden Type Coercion
- No Silent Heap Conversions
- Explicit Imports and Namespace Management
- Explicit Error Handling
- Explicit Lifetime of Every Value

Nary believes true ease of use comes from knowing exactly what's happening under the hood.
